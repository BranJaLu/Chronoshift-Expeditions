    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>Chronoshift Expeditions gives its visiters the chance to travel into the past.
        This allows every fan of prehistorical organism to see them in person when they
        were still around. Customers are also given permission to pet these organisms 
        though they have to make gloves while doing so.
    </p>
    <p>It is also important to make sure not to cause a rift to the timeline of the
        history of Earth. Doing so can be a problem back in the present. That's why 
        visiters need to pay close attention to all the rules and policies to protect
        the past.

    <h2>Cretaceous</h2>
    <p>The Creatacceous Period lasted from 145 to 66 million years ago. It was both 
        the thrid and final period of the Mesozoic Era as well as being the longest. 
        This period along with the Mesozoic period ended with the Creataceous-Palogene
        extinction event which killed off most of the dinosaurs with the exception of
        some avian dinosaurs which would become brids. The Creatacceous period would
        be followed by the Cenozoic Era which is still going on today.</p>

    <h2>Origin of life</h2>
    <p>Also known in biology as abiogenesis, is the natural process that life arisen from
        non-living matter such as organic compunds. The earliest organisms are unknown
        but they are believed to appear on Earth at least 3.37 Billion years ago 
        althought it could also be 4.28 billion years or even 4.42 billion years. These 
        early organisms would product offsprings and as time goes back, their offsprings 
        would develop unique traits that are essential to their environment and survival.
        Over time, each group of similar would diverge from each other to established their 
        own group.
