<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>Chronoshift Expeditions has the strictest rules in order to presevre the present timeline. One small mistake like 
    stepping on a mouse-like animal could cause a rift in time. Even killing the first organism could erase all organisms 
    including humans from the present day.</p>


<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>Since Chronoshift Expeditions does not allowing hunting in the past due to concerns that it could cause a crisis, 
    weapons should only be for defenses only. Weapons given to safari guides and visiters are meant to stun or frighten 
    off any dangers.</p>
<h3>Suit</h3>
<p>Considering that germs can get into anything and if they get into the past, these could evolved into something worse. 
    Time Travelers are to always wear a protective suit and mask so that way germs are not introduce into the past. This 
    also applies to protect the wearer from dangerous elements in the past.</p>
<h3>Taking Pictures</h3>
<p>While it's not allowed to take anything from the past, taking a picture is okay. First informed the safari guide that
    you are taking a picture. If they grant you permission, make sure not to go off the path as stated. The same applies
    for recording videos.
<h3>Time Period</h3>
<p>Traveling to any time period of human history is forbidden because it could change the course of human history from bad
    to even more worse. The period where humans are evolving however is okay. Make sure that you keep your distance away
    from them.
